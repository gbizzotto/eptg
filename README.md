EPTG stands for EPTG Picture TaGging

A simplistic file tagging system so you can go over your pictures, tag them and then find them easily.
No automatic tagging, no face recognition.

* Mouse-free tagging for speed
* Saves tags on persistent memory (your hard drive)

Features:

* Run shell command on all selected files
* Tag inheritance (tag your friends' pictures with their names and tag their names with "friend", so you can search for "friend" and retrieve all the pictures of your buddies)
* Advanced search with AND, OR and NOT keywords, and parenthesis. Default is AND.
* Autocompletion based on tag frequency
* Multiselection for mass tagging
* Picture preview for single and multiselection
